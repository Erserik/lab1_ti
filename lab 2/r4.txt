The legendary aport once made Almaty famous all over the world. What is happening with this unique apple variety now?
With this question in mind, we come to the Yenbekshikazakh district of the Almaty region to see Roman Safarov, the head of the Association of Aport Producers. He told Tengrinews.kz specifically how the famous apple, which has become a national brand, is grown today.
"The planting of the garden where we are now was in 1965. These trees are already 59 years old. And this is not the limit. Some producers of our association have 70-year-old trees," says Roman, proudly noting that with proper care, aport can bear fruit for up to 100 years, and the roots of the tree live up to three centuries.
We will talk about the roots later, but for now - a little history of the appearance of aport. In 1865, gardener Yegor Redko brought aport seedlings to the military fortification of Vernoye (now Almaty). He went to Kazakhstan to help grow vegetables and fruits. According to local legends, aport seedlings were nothing special until a breeder crossed them with the progenitor of all apples - the local "wild" Sievers. The symbiosis of the Sievers root and the aport bud became the basis for the famous Almaty apple, which subsequently won many international awards. By the 1970s, the number of aport trees in Kazakhstan reached almost four million. Today, there are about 250 hectares of fruit-bearing orchards in Almaty and the region (data from the association - editor's note). With a good harvest, gardeners collect about 2.5 thousand tons of apples, which is about 10 tons per hectare. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, aport in Kazakhstan occupies about two thousand hectares. However, the head of the Association of Almaty Aport Producers is skeptical about these figures. Roman Safarov admits: when he decided to start farming here, he did not plan to grow aport. However, the apple trees themselves decided otherwise.
"I honestly admit, you fall in love with this variety. It is simply impossible to destroy this tree - you can't bring yourself to cut it down. I just don't understand how people can deal with it so easily. And how beautiful it is in the spring! People come here for photo shoots to capture the blossoming apple trees. We, the members of the association, want to see more people in our community who are truly passionate and inspired by this variety. When everything is organized and centralized, it is much easier to cope with difficulties and share experiences."
A real aport, as Roman says, should grow at an altitude of 900 meters above sea level and higher. If you plant it lower, it will turn into a completely different apple: it will lose its unique aroma, and it will not be stored for as long.
We check: the height of the garden is almost 1200 meters. The conditions are ideal for aport.

	The last decade has seen a rapid increase in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning technologies in medicine. This is driven by the need to automate diagnostic and treatment processes, which are becoming increasingly complex due to the growing volume of medical data and the development of high-tech treatments. AI-based monitoring information and analytics systems have become key tools in improving the quality of medical care and supporting physicians' decision-making.
	The paper [1] describes the development of an automated system for patient health monitoring that utilizes cloud-based web technologies to improve accessibility and instant dissemination of updates.
	Paper [2] describes an e-health system designed to improve the care of cancer patients by passively monitoring their health status and providing customized reports.
	The authors researchers [3] describe a remote intelligent health monitoring system consisting of a mobile monitor, a mobile device, a medical facility server, and a family doctor's mobile computer. The system uses algorithms for remote processing of diagnostic information.
	The article [4] discusses the application of intelligent patient monitoring systems that utilize AI, biosensors, and expert medical knowledge to collect vital signs, assess clinical status, and provide diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations.
	A study [5] investigates the application of machine learning to classify the self-reported health status of patients over time. Activity trackers analyzed by machine learning are used to monitor the health status of patients in real time.
	The paper [6] discusses the application of deep learning in health informatics. It analyzes various deep learning approaches and techniques used for solving problems in health informatics.
	Article [7] Deep learning relies on neural networks that are modeled similarly to the structure of the human brain. Each layer of a neural network, consisting of nodes, or neurons, transforms input data using nonlinear activation functions and weighted links.
	The authors describe [8] that deep learning is one of the most advanced and promising technologies for analyzing medical data. Modern information and analytical systems that apply deep learning techniques can efficiently process large data sets, resulting in more personalized and accurate treatment of patients. The application of deep learning in analyzing medical images, identifying disease patterns, and predicting treatment outcomes allows physicians to obtain more detailed and reliable information about patients' health status.
	In [9], reinforcement learning and deep learning are discussed in combination. When it comes to building intelligent systems that can adapt and learn in changing environments, deep learning and reinforcement learning are closely related. The use of deep neural networks to estimate value functions and policies in reinforcement learning algorithms is one example of this interaction. A machine learning method called reinforcement learning (RL) trains an agent to interact with the environment in a way that maximizes the total reward. This approach is used to solve problems that require consistent decision making under uncertainty or changing environments.
	Into fundamental ideas in reinforcement learning. Such as robotics is training robots to perform complex tasks such as manipulating objects, navigating and interacting with the environment. [10] Autonomous Vehicles - this real-time learning is used to train autonomous vehicles to make real-time decisions based on road conditions. [11] Gaming - this is training agents to play video games, chess, and play Go at a level beyond human ability. [12] Finance is where RL is used to control risk, optimize trading methods, and automatically rebalance a portfolio. [13] Energy management is when RL is used to control energy saving devices and optimize energy usage in smart grids. [14]
	Their ability to analyze and model complex patterns has led to innovations in a wide variety of fields, revolutionizing markets and enhancing human potential. Deep learning and reinforcement learning technologies will only be used responsibly and profitably if existing challenges and ethical issues are addressed as research evolves.
	The paper [15] discusses the use of Reinforcement Learning deep learning algorithms to create models capable of classifying the health status of patients based on medical data. In this approach, the system has the ability to automatically adapt and adjust its predictions based on the rewards and penalties received during the learning process. The algorithm starts by defining the environment, which is a collection of patient health data including parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and other important parameters.
	The next step is state detection, where each state reflects the patient's current medical conditions, providing the model with informat
